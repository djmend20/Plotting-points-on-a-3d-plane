# Before executing script:
  Install matplotlib and pandas. Have both libraries in the correct file path. If not done right, ModuleNotFoundError is likely to 
  be the error 

# Other errors that can cause the program to crash are:
  1. Not providing the correct file with the appropriate file extension 
	2. Forgetting to exhange target value with the appropriate attribute names
	3. Other case could be not cleaning your data properly. Having text or Null 
	values will cause the program to end without producing a graph
