If Python has yet to be installed: 
Open terminal 
Instal Brew, a package manager by copying and pasting then hitting enter within terminal: 
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

Note not all packages work on the current released version of python so you may want to install python@3.9 or older.

After brew finishes installing then install python by 
copying and pasting then hitting enter within terminal:

brew install python@3.10 

Note if you wish to refresh the page without closing type into the terminal reset and hit enter
Note xy refers to your verion of python that has been installed

Run in terminal python3.xy to test if python has been installed 

Now to exit out type exit() then hit enter

Now installing pandas:


python3.xy -m pip install pandas 

Now to installing matplotlib: 

python3.xy -m pip install matplotlib

To find where matplotlib and pandas were created type: 
sudo find / -name matplotlib 

Hit enter. First you will be prompted to enter your password. After doing so you will see a list of file paths. Search through these by hitting command f. Use the keyword python. Copy the row with your version of python you used to install matplotlib and pandas. Paste this somewhere you can copy for later  

Copy the following into the terminal:
sudo nano /etc/paths 

Hit enter. This opens a file within terminal where you will add what you copied from the previous step. Delete from what you copied, /matplotlib 
. The purpose is so that the computer knows where the other packages will be installed via python pip.

hit control x. You will be prompted to save so hit y then enter and enter again.
